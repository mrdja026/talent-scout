Implementation Details
Flask Setup

    Use Flask-RESTful for API routing
    Implement CORS with Flask-CORS
    Use Flask-Marshmallow for serialization/validation

Mock Data & Latency

    Create realistic mock data matching frontend schemas
    Add configurable delay parameters to simulate processing
    Implement progress reporting for longer operations

Node Execution Simulation

    Simulate different node execution times based on type
    Implement state transitions (idle → running → complete)
    Create realistic mock data outputs based on node type

File Processing

    Store uploaded files temporarily in memory
    Extract real metadata from uploads (size, type, dimensions)
    Generate thumbnails for image files
    Simulate processing with appropriate delays

Template Storage

    Store templates in-memory initially (can be extended to database)
    Implement serialization/deserialization of workflow templates
    Support export/import functionality

Implementation Approach

    Basic Flask App Setup (1 hour)
        Initialize Flask application
        Set up project structure
        Configure CORS, error handling

    Core Data Models (1.5 hours)
        Implement model classes
        Create serialization schemas
        Add validation rules

    Mock Data Generation (1 hour)
        Create mock data factory
        Implement randomized data generators
        Add simulated latency utilities

    API Endpoints Implementation (4 hours)
        Implement all endpoints by category
        Add request validation
        Create response formatting

    Workflow Execution Simulation (2 hours)
        Implement state management
        Create mock execution engine
        Add data flow simulation

    File Processing Logic (2 hours)
        Implement file upload handling
        Add metadata extraction
        Create thumbnail generation

    Frontend Integration (2 hours)
        Update React services to use API
        Implement error handling
        Add loading states

Testing Strategy

    Unit tests for each API endpoint
    Integration tests for complex workflows
    Manual testing with Postman/curl

Deployment Considerations

    Ensure proper CORS configuration
    Add appropriate HTTP caching headers
    Implement request throttling for production
