# LocalAgentFlow Platform Development Request

## Project Overview
I'm building LocalAgentFlow, a distributed system for orchestrating AI agents using local language models. The platform consists of 5 major components:
1. Core Platform Architecture (microservices, LLM orchestration, visual workflow engine)
2. AI Agent Framework (agent system, workflow execution, local model integration)
3. Enterprise Integration Layer (data transformation, connectors)
4. Deployment Infrastructure (scalable runtime, monitoring)
5. Developer Experience (testing, documentation)

## Current Focus
I'm currently working on Core Platform Architecture, specifically the Visual Workflow Engine component. Help me implement this component with the following requirements:

# Technical Requirements for App n69n

## Executive Summary

The LocalAgentFlow platform is a comprehensive distributed system designed for orchestrating AI agents using local language models. The requirements are structured into five major epics: Core Platform Architecture, AI Agent Framework, Enterprise Integration Layer, Deployment Infrastructure, and Developer Experience. Each epic is broken down into specific tasks with detailed subtasks. Per the request, I've updated the technical requirements document to include the missing requirements in Phase 2 (Epic 2): Manual Steps and RAG System integration. These additions maintain the document's original structure and formatting while enhancing the platform's interactive capabilities and knowledge management.

2. ✅ Implement the core functionality
3. ✅ Create the drag and drop workflow designer 
4. ✅ Implement manual steps for user interaction
5. ✅ Replace in-memory storage with a database backend
6. ✅ Complete CRUD operations for agents, models, and connectors
7. ➡️ Implement RAG System integration for knowledge management
8. ➡️ Implement workflow validation and execution
9. ➡️ Add workflow templates and version control
10. ➡️ Expand connector ecosystem for integrations

## Additional Notes
- App needs to be testable with mock APIs that will simulate the local LLMs
- Real connection will be tackled later
- For backend and connection we will use Node.js with Express
- For frontend we're using React 18 with Vite

## BUGS
- **Arrow Connector Positioning**: There's an ongoing issue with arrow connectors not perfectly aligning with input ports. We've implemented several fixes to improve the positioning, but some alignment issues persist due to coordinate system differences between the SVG rendering and the DOM elements. This is a known issue on the critical path that needs further refinement.
