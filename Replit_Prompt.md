# Distributed AI Agent Orchestration Platform

## Core Functionality

This platform enables intelligent workflow design, system integration, and enhanced error management through comprehensive data connector management.

### Core Technologies
- React for dynamic frontend interfaces
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Microservices architecture with modular connector management
- Enhanced workflow execution and debugging support
- Real-time system monitoring with intelligent integration capabilities

## Key Features Implemented

### Workflow Management
- Visual workflow designer with drag-and-drop interface
- Workflow templates for common automation patterns
- Execution monitoring and status visualization
- Workflow versioning and history tracking
- Save, load, and reset workflows

### Node Types and Entity Management
- **Agent Nodes**: Connect to AI agents with specialized roles and capabilities
- **Model Nodes**: Interface with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Data Source Nodes**: Connect to external data sources and APIs
- **Transform Nodes**: Process and modify data flowing through the workflow
- **Manual Step Nodes**: Allow human-in-the-loop decision points
- **File Upload Nodes**: Enable document upload and processing

### Entity CRUD Operations
- **Agents**:
  - Create new agents with specified roles, goals and capabilities
  - Read agent details and configuration
  - Update agent parameters and settings
  - Delete agents no longer needed

- **Models**:
  - Create model configurations for various LLM providers
  - Read model capabilities and parameters
  - Update model settings and integration details
  - Delete unused model configurations

- **Data Connectors**:
  - Create connections to databases, APIs, and storage systems
  - Read connector configuration and status
  - Update connection parameters and authentication
  - Delete unused connectors

### Workflow Execution
- Real-time workflow state visualization
- Advanced node execution state tracking (idle, running, processing, waiting, complete, error)
- Asynchronous operation handling for AI agents and LLM models
- Progress indicators with estimated completion times for long-running operations
- Dependency tracking to ensure nodes wait for upstream AI/LLM operations to complete
- Visual progress feedback with completion percentage and status messages
- Data flow visualization between nodes
- Error handling and recovery options
- Manual step approval/rejection flow

### Entity-Node Integration
- **Entity-Specific Handling**: Specialized logic for entity-based nodes ensuring proper execution of agent tasks, model queries, and data operations
- **Connection Management**: Robust connections between different node types, including manual-to-entity transitions
- **Data Flow Enhancement**: Proper data transmission between nodes with entity reference preservation
- **Dynamic Port Configuration**: Input/output port management based on entity capabilities
- **Visual Connection Feedback**: Enhanced visual styling for entity connections with distinctive dashed lines, entity badges, and thicker connection lines

### Critical Path Improvements
- Fixed connection data structure mismatch between manual steps and entity nodes
- Enhanced entity node execution with proper context handling
- Improved data passing with entity reference preservation
- Added debugging and connection validation to prevent execution failures
